'join'-side queue page shows queued song titles and vote buttons. This is currently a hard-coded list, and the vote buttons don't do anything yet. Eventually song titles will be sent in string format from server.
Added a queue button to 'host'-side and moved forward/back buttons. Queue button is currently non-functional, but will lead to a list where songs can be added and queue order adjusted, votes should be visable too. This will eventually end up being a connection to the spotify api.
