# linklist
The Android app for collaborative dynamic playlists.
Hosting a party? Study session? Carpooling? Let LinkList enhance your musical experience by giving everyone the power to contribute.
Host a room. Let your guests join. Now everyone can search Spotify to add songs to one great playlist that fits everyone's tastes.

##Current Features
- Use the SpotifY API and Web Wrapper to search and play your favorite songs
- Host a lobby that your friends can join
- Guests can search all of Spotify to add songs they want to hear

##In Development
- More stable servers
- Relocation of Spotify LogIn page (you don't need it to just search for songs)
- Voting (guests can vote on songs that others have queued)
- Host control over lobby (reorder and delete from the queue, add to your own queue)
- Global playlists (default to a playlist of your favorite genre when your queue is empty)
- Text integration (guests don't have to download the app to participate)
